Workflow Framework

Process of the workflow


A case will be created 
A case will have a process
A process will be of a certain type (process type)
A process will have status
A process will also have steps
Steps will have status 
Steps will have also have tasks linked to them
Tasks will be linked to process definitions

Process definitions are linked to Process types

Process will also have process data 
Process data will be liked to process data type

Some additional requirements

An Admin needs to be able to add tasks, process definitions, Process Type and processdata type
User should be able to create a case number by choosing which process type the process type and provide information about the case 
And the system needs to create process record linking case number and process type giving status busy
And creating step linking to the created process and the start task no in process definition to task no field in task and giving and status busy
For the step to be closed we need to check the task rule if the rule is satisfied then create a new with the task no in the next step task no column
